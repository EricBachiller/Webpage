 <pre class="color" style="font-size:130%;">My name is Eric X. Bachiller Rosario, I'm 19 and I really love all sorts of technology. Ever since I was young I've always 
liked playing or tinkering with electronics and other similar appliances. Usually I'm the person my family calls for when they need techonological help. 
My mission it to be able to provide that service to a wider audiance and help as many people as I can with the things I learn from Holberton </pre>
